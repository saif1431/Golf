    summary: "This move addresses a common challenge: what to do during the downswing. Many golfers struggle with getting the club in the right position, leading to open clubfaces and inconsistent ball striking. By leveraging the natural momentum of the club, the Malaska Move provides a simple, effective solution to these issues.",

    content: "Mike observes that modern players often try to shallow the shaft during the downswing, which can lead to problems. “When you try to shallow the club and turn, your hands often push out, the clubface opens, and it becomes difficult to square the face at impact,” Mike explains.",
    content2: "Joe Nichols introduced Mike to a different approach: allowing the natural momentum of the club to work for you. When the club changes direction at the top of the swing, its momentum naturally wants to fall back. The key is to feel like you’re tipping the club or pulling the handle down. This move gets the club back in front of your body, setting up an efficient turn into the ball."
